# Project description

## Problem Statement

Small distributed teams face significant challenges with existing project management tools:

- **Censorship Vulnerability:** Centralized platforms (Jira, Trello, GitHub Projects) can restrict access or shut down accounts
- **Data Sovereignty Issues:** Teams lose control of project data to third-party servers
- **Cost Barriers:** Enterprise tools are expensive and over-engineered for small teams
- **Centralized Dependencies:** Most tools require centralized infrastructure, creating single points of failure

## Solution

NostrTrack is a lightweight, Nostr-native project tracking system designed specifically for small distributed teams. It combines:

- **Decentralized Architecture:** Built on Nostr for censorship-resistant data storage and user authentication
- **CLI/TUI-First Workflow:** Terminal-based interface for speed, privacy, and low-resource environments
- **Local Web Hosting:** Optional self-hosted web interface that avoids centralized servers
- **Agile Essentials:** Core features inspired by Pivotal Tracker/Trello (sprints, backlogs, task assignment)

## Key Features

- **Nostr Integration:** User authentication via Nostr keys; project data stored as Nostr events
- **Core Functionality:** Create projects, manage tasks, assign owners, track status (To Do/In Progress/Done)
- **Agile Support:** Sprints, story points, backlog prioritization
- **Dual Interfaces:** Full-featured CLI/TUI + locally launchable web UI
- **Data Portability:** Export/import projects (JSON/CSV)

# Project impact

## For Teams

- **Censorship Resistance:** Operate in restricted environments without fear of platform shutdowns
- **Data Ownership:** Full control over project data (no vendor lock-in)
- **Accessibility:** Low-cost, low-resource solution (runs on Raspberry Pi or old laptops)
- **Privacy:** No tracking, ads, or data mining

## For the Nostr Ecosystem

- **Utility Expansion:** Demonstrates Nostr's potential beyond social media (productivity tools)
- **Developer Onboarding:** Provides a practical use case for developers exploring Nostr
- **Community Growth:** Attracts project managers and non-technical users to Nostr

## Broader Implications

- **Open Source Contribution:** Code will be MIT-licensed, fostering community-driven improvements
- **Decentralized Workflows:** Paves the way for other Nostr-based collaboration tools (e.g., docs, wikis)
- **Global Accessibility:** Empowers teams in regions with internet restrictions or limited infrastructure
