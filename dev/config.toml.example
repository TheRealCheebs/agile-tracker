# Example config for nostr-rs-relay
# This is a minimal example to run a local relay for development.
# Check your relay implementation's docs for full configuration options.

# Bind settings
bind_address = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8080

# Logging
log_level = "info"

# Database / storage path used by the relay (inside container)
# The compose file mounts `./data` to `/usr/src/app/db`, so a typical
# path below would be inside that directory.
database_path = "/usr/src/app/db/nostr-relay.db"

# Simple CORS/allowed origins example (adjust as needed)
allowed_origins = ["*"]

# Additional settings may be required by your chosen relay implementation.
# Use this file as a starting point and consult the relay project's docs.
